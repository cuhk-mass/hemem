--- Now ---

* For a consecutive virtual address range, we can track what base page mappings are completely in
  NVM
  * For those, we can check the larger page table entries

* Implement page frequency tracking, instead of LRU tracking

* We can move small 4K pages up, and space them out to allow the rest
  to move up if needed

--- Done ---

x Implement paper description of memory management

x Implement memory mode

x Fix page and TLB lookups (need page alignment, not absolute addresses)

--- Later ---

* Linux will move pages unmodified (whatever size they were)
