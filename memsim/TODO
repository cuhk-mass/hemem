--- Now ---

* If data is read-only, then migrate up only if it's at least a huge
  page worth of data or if it's scattered 4K pages.
* If data is written, then always migrate anything that's touched up.
* When moving 4K pages up, space them out to allow the rest to move up if needed

* When to promote to huge page?
  * If hot dataset is smaller than fastmem, we should always promote
  * If hot dataset is larger than fastmem, we should reduce bloating
   
* Implement page frequency tracking, instead of LRU tracking

* Could do inclusive caching for read-only data
  * Detect if written through dirty bit
   
--- Done ---

x Implement paper description of memory management

x Implement memory mode

x Fix page and TLB lookups (need page alignment, not absolute addresses)

x For a consecutive virtual address range, we can track what base page mappings are completely in
  NVM
  x For those, we can check the larger page table entries

--- Later ---

x Linux will move pages unmodified (whatever size they were)
